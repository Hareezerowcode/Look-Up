The information you give us may include your name, address, e-mail address and phone number, financial and credit card information, personal description and photographs.</li><li>You may also provide us with additional information either when you access the private section to your Lookup Page (which occurs only after you have created an account), communicate with us in relation to a product or other service, or or when you sign-up to a premium feature that we may offer to you as an add-on to the Service e.g. financial and payment card information.</li><li>Section C explains some circumstances in which your information may be shared to third parties. The circumstances explained in Section C apply to both personal and non-personal information.

If you choose not to submit this information, you may not be able to receive our Services.</li></ul><p class="font-blue-80 margin-bottom-base"><strong>Purpose and basis of collecting your personal information</strong></p><ul role="list" class="margin-bottom-xl"><li>We use your personal information for the purposes described below, except where restricted by law. In doing so, we rely on a number of separate legal bases to lawfully process such information.</li><li>We process your personal information where it is necessary to perform our contractual obligations with you. In particular, we process your personal information to provide the Service to you at your request. For example, we ask for your name and email address to allow you to access the private section of your Lookup page. We also use your personal information to administer and manage our relationship with you and when dealing with your enquiries relating to the Service.</li><li>We may also process your information where necessary to further our legitimate interests where those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests. In particular, the processing of your personal information is necessary for the operation, improvement and expansion of the Service that we provide to you. It is also in our legitimate interests to use your personal information to communicate with you about our Services. If you do not object to us using your personal information, we may provide you marketing for our Services. It is in our legitimate interests to promote and market our Services. An example of when we rely on this legal basis is when we use your email address or telephone number to survey you on your experience of the Service to date and gauge your interest in new features or service offerings that we think you could benefit from.</li><li>We may also process your information where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation of ours such as in relation to the preparation of Lookup's annual compliance accounts.</li></ul><p class="font-blue-80 margin-bottom-base"><strong>Sharing of your personal information</strong></p><p class="font-blue-80 margin-bottom-base">Where necessary, and in accordance with the purposes set out in this Policy, we share your personal information with third parties. We use a number of external providers to assist us to run and manage our business. Some of the areas that we use external service providers to assist us to manage our business and to provide the Service to you include:-</p><ul role="list" class="margin-bottom-xl"><li>Accounting software provider</li><li>Shipping, postage and return service providers</li><li>Document management service providers</li><li>Payment card and payment processors</li><li>Cloud computing providers</li><li>Email service provider</li><li>VOIP telephone calling service provider</li><li>Web chat service provider</li><li>Customer relationship management software provider</li></ul><p class="font-blue-80 margin-bottom-base">When we outsource the processing of personal information to these service providers, we require those third parties to protect that personal information with appropriate security measures and prohibit or restrict them from using the personal information for their own purposes or from disclosing the personal information to others. For example the web chat provider we use on our website can only process your email address for the purpose of facilitating you communicating with Lookup using that said provider’s web chat solution. They are not permitted to use the information we provide them to contact you or disclose that information to another third party.</p><p class="font-blue-80 margin-bottom-xl">Please see also Section C for additional circumstances in which personal information may be shared with third parties.</p><p class="font-blue-80 margin-bottom-base"><strong>Security</strong></p><ul role="list" class="margin-bottom-xl"><li>All the information you provide to us is stored on secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access the private section of your Lookup page, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share user passwords with anyone.</li><li>The security of information transmitted via the internet cannot be completely guaranteed. Although we implement appropriate technical and organisational safeguards to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our Service; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use appropriate procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised access.</li></ul><p class="font-blue-80 margin-bottom-base"><strong>Data transfer</strong></p><ul role="list" class="margin-bottom-xl"><li>The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. The privacy protections in these countries may not be equivalent to those in the EEA. We will only transfer personal information outside of the EEA where permitted to do so by law. These transfers are necessary for the management of the Lookup's business operations. Lookup relies on the European Commission’s adequacy decisions on certain countries to transfer your information from the EEA</li></ul><p class="font-blue-80 margin-bottom-base"><strong>Your rights</strong></p><p class="font-blue-80 margin-bottom-base padding-left-40px">You have the following rights regarding the processing of your personal information:</p><ul role="list" class="margin-bottom-xl"><li>Request access to a copy of any personal information we hold about you</li><li>Request any inaccurate or incomplete personal information to be rectified</li><li>Request the erasure of your personal information</li><li>Object to or restrict the processing in specified circumstances</li><li>Request that your personal information be transferred to another data controller or provided in a format that will permit this transfer (i.e. right to data portability)</li><li>Make a complaint to the applicable supervisory authority</li><li>These rights may be restricted in certain circumstances, for instance where your information may be needed to comply with our legal obligations or for the defence or exercise of legal claims.</li></ul><p class="font-blue-80 margin-bottom-base">These rights may be restricted in certain circumstances, for instance where your information may be needed to comply with our legal obligations or for the defence or exercise of legal claims.</p><p class="font-blue-80 margin-bottom-base">If you no longer wish for us to process your personal information as part of the Services you should immediately deactivate your account, disconnect any Lookup boxes from your POS equipment or cease transmitting information either by POS Integration or manual upload. Following this, you should contact us so that we can arrange the return of any Lookup boxes. Any information you have already provided to us or that we have collected from you or that we have received from third parties about you, may have already been used by us as outlined in this Policy. Our information retention policy is described below.</p><p class="font-blue-80 margin-bottom-base">You can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details listed at the end of the Policy.</p><p class="font-blue-80 margin-bottom-xl">In circumstances where you are not satisfied with our use of your personal information or you are not satisfied with how we have responded to your request to exercise your rights, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Irish Data Protection Commission, www.dataprotection.ie, (who is Lookup lead supervisory authority) or your local supervisory authority in the country in which you reside, whichever is more convenient.

This feature is typically referred to as “Do Not Track”. Currently we do not look for or respond to Do Not Track preferences made by visitors to our website.</p><p class="font-blue-80 margin-bottom-xl">We work with various reputable third party services to help analyze and optimize our website, for example Google Analytics, Facebook and Adroll. We carefully vet companies with which we work, however we have no direct control over how these third parties track users to or from our website.</p><p class="font-blue-80 margin-bottom-base"><strong>Access To Third Party Websites</strong></p><p class="font-blue-80 margin-bottom-64">Our Service may, from time to time, contain links to and from third-party sites.

Please check these policies before you submit any personal information to these websites.</p><h2 class="margin-bottom-xl">Section B - Product Information</h2><p class="font-blue-80 margin-bottom-base padding-left-40px">To enable the Services to operate, we require every store on Lookup to send us product information. We use multiple methods to collect product information:</p><ul role="list" class="margin-bottom-xl"><li>We may supply your store with a hardware device (the "Lookup box") which connects to your barcode scanner. We may also supply your store with a Lookup box to connect to your receipt printer. Whenever the scanner is used, the Lookup box sends us the barcode information. And whenever the receipt printer is used the Lookup box connected to it sends us receipt information.</li><li>The Lookup box can only transmit barcode information from the barcode scanner it is connected to, or receipt information from the receipt printer it is connected to. The Lookup box does not download any information from your POS, nor does it integrate with any of the software running on your POS. Any information stored on the POS cannot be read by the lookup box and will never be transmitted to us by the Lookup box.</li><li>You may also send us product information by way of manual upload.</li></ul><p class="font-blue-80 margin-bottom-base"><strong>How we use product information</strong></p><p class="font-blue-80 margin-bottom-base padding-left-40px">We will use this information to:</p><ul role="list" class="margin-bottom-xl"><li>Provide you with the Services and any other services that you request from us, for example to display and promote your products online, increasing online visibility of your store for the purpose of creating more in-store visits.</li><li>ensure a good consumer experience by displaying accurate product information online. For example, we display the stock status of products so that consumers have added information about the products you sell, increasing the likelihood of an in-store visit.</li></ul><p class="font-blue-80 margin-bottom-base"><strong>Additional product information supplied by retailers</strong></p><ul role="list" class="margin-bottom-xl"><li>We will use any additional product information supplied by you (e.g. manual upload information) to improve the Services as a whole. The additional product information will be combined and compared with our other sources of product information to ensure that we present the best and most accurate product information to consumers.</li><li>For example, should the additional basic product details you supply be sufficient to display a product on Lookup for which we previously had incomplete information, both you and any other retailer who sells that product will benefit by having the product appear on your respective Lookup pages.</li></ul><p class="font-blue-80 margin-bottom-base"><strong>Who we may share the information with</strong></p><ul role="list" class="margin-bottom-xl"><li>Your product information is commercially sensitive to your business.
